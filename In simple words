1.1	Understanding Battery Chemistry and Working Principles
A battery is essentially an electrochemical device that stores energy in chemical form and converts it into electrical energy when required. Each battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells, which in turn are composed of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. When connected to an external load, chemical reactions occur between the electrodes and the electrolyte, releasing electrons that flow through the external circuit and generate an electric current.
Among the various battery formats used today, cylindrical lithium-ion cells are the most common. These cells come in standard sizes such as 18650 (18 mm diameter and 65 mm length), 21700 (21 mm diameter and 70 mm length), and 32650 (32 mm diameter and 65 mm length). The 18650 cells has been a staple in laptops and early EVs since the 1990s. The 21700 cell offers approximately 35% more energy density by volume and is now widely used in modern electric vehicles like the Tesla Model 3. The 32650 formats, often associated with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry, provides a nominal voltage of 3.2V and a typical capacity of 5000 mAh.

1.2	Types of Battery Cells
Battery cells are available in multiple formats, each with its own characteristics and application domains. Cylindrical cells are the most widely used due to their structural integrity, ease of manufacturing, and superior thermal performance. They are prevalent in power tools, consumer electronics, and electric vehicles. Models like the 18650 and 21700 offer capacities ranging from 2.0 Ah to 5.0 Ah, depending on their design and chemistry.
Button or coin cells are compact and commonly found in low-power devices such as watches, hearing aids, and medical implants. These cells are typically non-rechargeable and lack built-in safety mechanisms, making them susceptible to swelling if charged improperly.
Prismatic cells were introduced in the 1990s to provide a more compact and space-efficient battery format. These cells are encased in hard plastic or metal enclosures and are used in mobile phones, tablets, and electric vehicles. Their capacities can range from 800 mAh in consumer electronics to 50 Ah in automotive applications. Despite their space-saving design, prismatic cells are costlier and more prone to swelling and shorter cycle life.
Pouch cells represent a more recent advancement, introduced in 1995. These cells use flexible aluminium-laminate pouches instead of rigid casings, allowing for lightweight and high energy density designs. With packaging efficiency as high as 95%, pouch cells are widely used in EVs and energy storage systems. However, they require additional space for expansion and reinforcement for structural stability.

1.3 Battery Configurations
Batteries can be arranged in different configurations to meet specific power and energy requirements. A single-cell configuration is commonly used in small electronics such as mobile phones and remote controls. The nominal voltage of a single cell varies based on the chemistry—for example, 1.2V for nickel-based cells, 1.5V for alkaline, 3.6V for Li-ion, and 3.2V for LFP cells.
In a series configuration, multiple cells are connected end-to-end to increase the total voltage of the battery pack. For instance, four 3.6V Li-ion cells connected in series yield a combined voltage of 14.4V. This setup is prevalent in applications requiring higher voltage, such as e-bikes and electric cars with voltage systems ranging from 36V to over 500V. However, careful matching and monitoring of cell voltages are necessary to prevent imbalances that could compromise the system.
Parallel configurations, on the other hand, are used to increase the capacity of the battery without changing the voltage. While these configurations are generally safer, a failed cell can significantly reduce overall capacity. In real-world applications, batteries often use a series/parallel configuration to balance both voltage and capacity requirements. For example, a 2S2P configuration using four 3.6V, 3400 mAh cells results in a 7.2V battery with a total energy of around 49 Wh. These complex arrangements require Battery Management Systems (BMS) to ensure safe and balanced operation.
The total power output of a battery is determined by the product of its voltage and current 
(P = V × I), making configuration decisions crucial to system performance.

1.4 Safety Mechanisms in Cylindrical Cells
Cylindrical cells, particularly the 18650 formats, include several built-in safety features to ensure reliable performance. The metal jacket provides mechanical stability and thermal protection. Terminal contacts allow for electrical connectivity, while a vent hole on the positive terminal allows gases to escape in the event of internal pressure buildup. Scoring lines guide this venting to ensure a controlled release of pressure.
Additional safety mechanisms include the Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) device, which increases resistance under high current to prevent short circuits, and the Current Interrupt Device (CID), which disconnects the internal circuit under excessive pressure. Internal components like plastic insulation disks and metallic foils further protect against electrical and thermal hazards.

1.5 Lithium-Ion Battery Chemistries
Several lithium-ion chemistries are used in EVs and other applications, each with unique trade-offs in energy density, safety, cost, and lifespan.
Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) is commonly used in portable electronics such as laptops and smartphones due to its high energy density. However, it suffers from poor thermal stability, short cycle life, and reliance on expensive and ethically problematic cobalt.
Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) is gaining popularity in EVs and energy storage systems thanks to its excellent thermal stability, long cycle life, and inherent safety. It does not contain cobalt, making it a more ethical and cost-effective choice. However, it has lower energy density compared to other chemistries.
Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) offers a balanced performance profile, making it suitable for both EVs and stationary energy storage. It combines decent energy density, power delivery, and lifespan but remains costly due to cobalt content.
Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide (NCA) is used in high-performance applications like Tesla vehicles. It provides high energy density and long lifespan but poses challenges in terms of cost and thermal stability.
Lithium Titanate (LTO) is known for its exceptional safety, ultra-fast charging capability, and very long cycle life. These characteristics make it suitable for grid storage and specialized transport applications. However, its lower energy density limits its use in mainstream EVs.

1.6 The Role of Battery Management Systems (BMS)
A Battery Management System (BMS) is a crucial component in any modern battery-powered system, especially in EVs. It monitors key parameters such as State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH), voltage, current, and temperature of each cell. The BMS protects the battery from overcharging, deep discharging, overheating, and short circuits. It also estimates the remaining capacity and monitors degradation trends, which are vital for maintaining battery longevity and safety.
The BMS ensures uniform performance by balancing the charge among cells, either through passive (resistive) or active (charge redistribution) methods. In complex EV battery packs, the BMS plays a vital role in communication with other vehicle systems, thermal management, and diagnostics, ensuring safe, efficient, and reliable operation throughout the battery’s lifecycle.
